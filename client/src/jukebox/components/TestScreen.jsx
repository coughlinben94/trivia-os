// The tuning screen. Deliberately a SECOND, separate mount of the real
// LiveScreen — not a preview, not a static picker.
//
// Why the real thing: the whole point is judging the gradient against what
// actually happens during a show — the entrance blend, the song-to-song
// crossfade, the light drift behind a spinning record. A still preview of one
// album's palette tells you nothing about any of that. So the TUNE button in
// Jukebox.jsx calls the same startShuffle() the Space bar calls, real audio
// plays, and this screen mounts the real LiveScreen with the board bolted on.
//
// Why it's still separate from the Live flow: Jukebox.jsx routes the "track
// confirmed" moment to showTest instead of showLive while this is open, so
// `showLive` never flips true and the real Live path — Space bar, the Live
// header toggle, the `b` handoff — is untouched. Closing stops playback and
// hands everything back exactly as handleStop() would from the library view.

  // gradientTuning.js's DIALS, because changing it means an actual network
  // refetch of the extracted palette (/api/palette query string), and
  // usePalette only refetches when its effect re-runs. Every other dial
  // (BRIGHTNESS/MOTION/SIZE/BLEND/DEPTH/CROSSFADE) is read live, every frame,
  // straight out of AlbumGradientMesh.jsx's draw() loop — no prepared/baked
  // scene state left to rebuild, so no remount needed for those.
