// Canvas2D "soft mesh" gradient background — revived 2026-08-04 from
// commit abdf50e (2026-07-19, "rebuild color math as real two-color
// collision, not an 8-way average" — the actual clean rewrite, NOT the
// later c5e9673 "+25% intensity" commit, which was hand-tuned to compensate
// for a since-fixed bad-palette bug and is a worse base). Adapted to the
// app's current 2-color-max data model, and fixed against a second-opinion
// review of the original build (2026-08-04):
//
//  - Accent-color system deleted. The original drew up to 8 colors — 2
//    "anchor" colors always present, plus up to 6 "accent" colors fading in
//    and out — and burned about a week of tuning (mud guards, antipodal
//    blob pairing, chroma floors, hue-distance gating) fighting muddy/ugly
//    results from bad AUTO-EXTRACTED palettes across that many colors. The
//    app is now hard-capped at exactly 2 colors (LiveScreen.pickGradientColors)
//    and both are picker-overridable per song (SongDetailModal) with a
//    cover-art eyedropper — that's what actually solves "bad color," not more
//    blend-math guardrails. Only the 2-anchor duel survives; there's no
//    NUM_COLORS > 2 path left to feed accents.
//  - ANCHOR_FLOOR clamp removed. The original never let either anchor color
//    render at full strength anywhere on screen (clamped to a 18-22%..78-82%
//    mix range) — directly undermining a picker where you choose an exact
//    color and expect to actually see it. Colors now reach full strength
//    wherever an anchor wins; the tanh sharpening still keeps the transition
//    soft, it just isn't artificially prevented from resolving.
//  - Song-to-song crossfade now blends in OKLab, not RGB. The original's
//    per-pixel mix was already OKLab, but the OUTER crossfade between one
//    song's colors and the next was still a plain RGB lerp — exactly the
//    "muddy gray seam" problem this engine exists to avoid, just left
//    unfixed on the transition path. Two opposite-hue picks (e.g. red to
//    blue) now cross through a real perceptual gradient instead of gray.
//  - Grain removed entirely (2026-08-04, Fable's critique) — 700 fillRect
//    calls a frame for ~0.03% pixel coverage on a TV-sized canvas was pure
//    cost with no visible payoff; see the note above the old call site.
//  - Divider motion reworked (2026-08-04, Fable's critique): the single-sine
//    sweep was outweighed 5:1 by the local noise term, so it barely read as
//    travel — swing raised, divider is now 3 incommensurate sine periods so
//    it never exactly repeats, the boundary slowly tilts off-vertical, and
//    FLOW_SPEED breathes instead of sitting at one constant tempo.
//
// Colors are mixed in OKLab (perceptual color space), not composited with
// 'screen' blend like AlbumGradient.jsx (the circle-blobs engine) — screen-
// blending overlapping shapes is additive and is what produced washed-out/
// white blob centers there. OKLab lerp between two colors can only ever
// land between them, never brighter than either.
//
// Same prop contract as AlbumGradient.jsx (colors/nextColors/active/
// shuffleKey/entranceActive) so it drops into LiveScreen.jsx with no other
// changes needed.

// Song-to-song crossfade length — was a fixed 7500ms module const until the
// 2026-08-07 tuning dial rewire, now live off the CROSSFADE dial
// (gradientTuning.js's blendDurationMs(), 50 -> 7500, same value). Read at
// each call site below rather than hoisted to a const, since default
// params/expressions re-evaluate per call in JS — a drag mid-show is picked
// up on the very next song-to-song transition.
//
// The entrance's own first real-palette blend (near-black -> real colors) is
// much shorter than a normal song-to-song crossfade — see startBlendTo's
// header comment. Deliberately NOT on the CROSSFADE dial — it's a one-time
// near-black reveal, not a repeating "how long between songs" question.

// flowSpeedAt() below) instead of sitting at one constant tempo forever —
// 2026-08-04, per Fable's critique: a fixed speed reads as a metronome
// after a couple hours of a bar shift. Base value (was a fixed 0.55 module
// const, 0.79 -> 0.55 2026-08-04, Ben: noise flow read too fast live) is now

// 0.30 -> 0.65 (2026-08-04, Fable's critique): at 0.30 the divider sweep was
// outweighed 5:1 by ANCHOR_NOISE_CONTRAST (1.5), so the noise churn WAS the
// motion and the actual 11.4s travel barely registered — probably why past
// tuning kept reaching for FLOW_SPEED as the only lever that visibly did
// anything. Raising this lets the sweep read as real travel.
const ANCHOR_SWING      = 0.65  // how much the sweeping divider contributes to who's winning, vs. local noise texture
const ANCHOR_SHARPNESS  = 3.5   // divider position->edge transition — lower = blurrier, higher = crisper
// ANCHOR_NOISE_CONTRAST and ANCHOR_MIX_SHARPNESS were fixed module consts
// (1.5 and 1.4) until the 2026-08-07 tuning dial rewire — both are now live
// off the DEPTH/BLEND dials (gradientTuning.js's noiseContrast()/
// mixSharpness(), hoisted once per frame in draw() as liveNoiseContrast/
// liveMixSharpness, not the module scope, since T() reads localStorage and
// this file's inner loop runs 48x48 times a frame). 1.4/1.5 are still the
// exact values both dials produce at their default (T=50) position — see
// the tuning file for why those particular numbers, the history below is
// about why 1.4 specifically was chosen as BLEND's own default, not a
// module const anymore.
//
// 2.4 -> 1.4 (2026-08-04, Fable's critique, second round): owner reported
// each color's DOMINANT interior (not the seam) reading as one flat heavy
// block. Math: deep in a stronghold, edge saturates to ~+-1 (ANCHOR_SHARPNESS
// already does that within ~0.3 screen-widths of the divider), so score sits
// around +-0.65 from swing alone plus noise wobble. At 2.4, tanh(2.4*0.65)
// pins mix ~0.96 even at the LOW end of core wobble -- almost the whole
// stronghold reads as one pinned-near-pure block with only faint texture,
// and the visible blend band (mix 0.25-0.75) is a thin ribbon by comparison.
// At 1.4, a typical core (score 0.65) lands at mix ~0.86 -- strong, but
// breathing, with noise texture visibly modulating it -- while true peaks
// (score ~1.2) still reach ~0.97, so a hand-picked color still renders
// essentially full-strength somewhere (preserves the no-ANCHOR_FLOOR fix
// above). The blend band roughly doubles in width as a side effect.
// No ANCHOR_FLOOR — see file header. tanh already keeps the transition soft;
// nothing forces a trace of the "losing" color to survive into its own
// stronghold anymore.

// Divider position, 2026-08-04: sum of three incommensurate periods instead
// of one pure sine. A single sine repeats exactly every ANCHOR_PERIOD_S — on
// an hours-long bar shift the eye eventually clocks the loop. Three periods
// with no common factor (11.4s / 29.3s / 7.1s) mean the combined waveform
// doesn't actually repeat on any timescale a viewer would sit through.
//
// Amplitudes scaled to 0.5x (2026-08-07, Ben live: "there isn't supposed to
// be a max of the sin wave bleeding over into the other color") — the
// original 0.35/0.15/0.10 amplitudes summed to 0.60, so at their combined
// peak the divider left the visible 0-1 screen range entirely (as far as
// -0.10 / 1.10), which saturates the edge term across nearly the whole
// canvas and lets one anchor color swallow the screen. Simulated over a 4hr
// shift: this happened 4.5% of the time. Scaling all three by the same
// factor keeps their relative sizes (same multi-wave "random" shape) while
// capping the combined swing at +-0.3, so the divider always stays within
// 0.2-0.8 — both colors stay visibly present no matter how the three waves
// line up.
//
// offsetCap (2026-08-07, tuning dial rewire — SIZE) parametrizes that same
// 0.3 ceiling instead of hardcoding it, so gradientTuning.js's
// dividerOffsetCap() can drive it live. Default stays 0.30 — the exact fixed
// value shipped above — so every existing caller (draw() before this rewire,
// both test files) is unaffected unless it explicitly passes a different
// cap. The three sines keep their original relative proportions (7:3:2,
// i.e. 0.175:0.075:0.05 at cap=0.3) so scaling the cap up or down preserves
// the same "3 incommensurate periods" shape, just bigger or smaller.

// genuinely orbiting each other, producing continuous boundary rotation; this
// renderer's own divider only ever swept left-right (anchorDivider above),
// with a small fixed y-lean (`tilt`, now removed) standing in for real
// rotation. This is the real thing: theta is the angle of the dividing
// line's normal vector, consumed by draw() as cos(theta)/sin(theta) in a
// signed-distance projection — see the edge computation there.
//
// NOT a constant rotation rate (`2*pi*t/T`) — a clock hand doing N identical
// revolutions over an hours-long shift is exactly the periodicity class this
// file has been fixed for five separate times already (see anchorDivider's
// own history above). The linear term is jittered by two faster,
// incommensurate sines whose combined rate-of-change (0.9/37 + 0.6/61 =
// 0.034) exceeds the linear term's own rate (2*pi/300 = 0.021) — the

// reason about — flowPhaseRef and hiddenOffsetMsRef — a third invites the
// exact class of resume bug those two exist to prevent).
//
// Note: rotating the line's normal by pi swaps which color is on which side

// Polar OKLab lerp — rewritten 2026-08-07 (Opus review) after the version

// identical to a plain Cartesian lerp of the a/b channels (algebra + a
// 300k-random-pair numeric check, max deviation 3.9e-16, float noise only).
// Full history, for the next person who touches this:
//
//   1. (2026-08-04) Original bug: two near-complementary hues (e.g.
//      orange/blue) point roughly opposite directions in the a/b plane, so
//      their vector SUM cancels toward the origin at the midpoint -- chroma
//      collapses near 0 (gray) even though L and each endpoint's own chroma
//      are both fine. Fixed by blending unit hue VECTORS (not raw atan2 hues
//      + a shortest-path branch, which flips discretely as live-drifting
//      anchors sweep their hue gap past +-180deg, producing a full-width
//      single-frame color jump mid-crossfade).
//
//   2. (2026-08-06) That vector blend's magnitude (`ulen`) naturally shrinks
//      toward 0 near exact antipodality (180deg apart) -- atan2 near the
//      origin is ill-defined, so the resolved hue swung between two
//      arbitrary values a hair's-width apart in t while chroma held its
//      full lerped value, committing to a wrong saturated hue right at the
//      unstable point ("swimming ring" bug, live-verified on Out Tonight /
//      Penelope Road, #115867/#e45a34, ~180deg apart). Fixed by scaling
//      output chroma by `ulen`.
//
//   Fix #2 is the bug. `ulen` is EXACTLY the ratio between the unit-vector
//   blend's magnitude and the Cartesian lerp's magnitude -- multiplying it
//   back in after computing hue/magnitude from the unit vectors algebraically
//   reconstructs the plain Cartesian lerp of (a,b), i.e. fix #1, undone.
//   Every comment that used to be here describing "chroma can't cancel, it's
//   a scalar magnitude" was describing intent, not the code beneath it.
//
// The actual fix for both bugs at once: don't re-derive hue direction PER
// PIXEL at all. The unit-vector trick existed only to make direction
// continuous as the CALLER's two input hues drift frame to frame (draw()
// calls this once per pixel per frame with the SAME pair of live-moving
// anchors) -- but if the caller instead fixes the traversal arc ONCE per
// frame (see hueArcRef in draw()), every pixel that frame uses the same
// monotone hue path, so there's no per-pixel instability left to guard
// against, and chroma can lerp as a true scalar magnitude with nothing
// scaling it down. The `dh` param carries that caller-fixed arc; frame-to-
// frame stability (the actual antipodality hazard, now once-per-frame
// instead of once-per-pixel) is an unwrap in draw(), not anything in here —
// see hueArcRef there for why it's an unwrap and not a threshold/hysteresis.
//
// L lerps linearly. Chroma lerps as a scalar magnitude — two positive
// numbers can't average to something smaller than both, so this is where
// bug #1 actually stays fixed. Hue lerps along `dh` (or the shortest path
// between a/b's own hues, if the caller has no per-frame drift to worry
// about — see the crossfade call in currentOklab(), whose endpoints are
// fixed for the life of one blend), with the blend fraction itself
// chroma-weighted (unchanged from the original design): a near-achromatic
// endpoint has an arbitrary atan2 hue and should barely vote on the result.
