## The Ambient Design Law

Every reworked ambient = **anchor + drifter + atmosphere**, with the center kept open.

1. **Anchor** — one named focal element you can point at and name ("the torch," "the god-rays,"
   "the bouncing apple"). Soft glowing light-forms (sun disc, neon sign, SVG curtain) **and** defined
   sprites (an original pixel critter) are both allowed. One near-hard edge keeps the anchor from
   turning to mush; all-soft = mush, all-hard = clip-art.
2. **Drifter** — at least one element with real `translate` motion you can track across the frame
   (not just breathing in place).
3. **Atmosphere** — layered gradient washes / glows sitting behind the anchor and drifter.

**Center safe-area:** middle 60% width (20–80%) × middle 45% height (28–72%). Don't park a focal or
high-energy element inside it. Atmosphere and low-energy motion may pass behind; a drifter may transit
through, just don't anchor there.

## Color, in-family

Every ambient hue lives inside the theme's `accent → highlight` range. Sanctioned exceptions: a hot
near-white core at the anchor, and dark silhouette drifters.

**Updated 2026-07-01:** ambients no longer hand-hardcode dead hex values. Each `AmbientComponent`
receives a `tint(originalColorStr)` function as a prop from `ParticleBackground.jsx`
(`client/src/lib/colorTint.js`'s `deriveTint`, anchored on the theme's `highlight` color). Call
`tint('#f5a623')` (or with an `rgba(...)` string, alpha preserved) on every in-family hue color in the
component — this reproduces the original hand-tuned color exactly when no per-show override is active,
and shifts the whole family cohesively (same hue delta, same saturation/lightness scale) when a host
overrides the show's highlight color from `ThemePickerModal.jsx`'s Customize row. **Do not wrap
sanctioned exceptions** (hot near-white cores, dark silhouette drifters) in `tint()` — those are
intentionally hue-agnostic and must stay literal. There is no `accent`-anchor option — an earlier
version exposed one, but it was numerically unstable (accent colors are usually very dark washes, so
the lightness-scale ratio blows up) and every one of the 21 themes anchored on highlight anyway, so it
was removed.

## GPU rule (replaces "never filter / never box-shadow")

Animate **only** `transform` and `opacity`. Never animate `width/height/color/box-shadow/filter/
background-position` or any layout property. **Static** `filter` (blur, drop-shadow) and **static**
`box-shadow` are now allowed — the ban is on *animating* them, not on using them.

## Reduced motion

Every keyframe set needs a `prefers-reduced-motion` branch via a guard class
(e.g. `.xx-anim { animation: none !important }`) on every animated element.

## No copyrighted IP

Original forms only. No trademarked characters, sprites, logos, or licensed art — these run on
commercial TVs in front of paying guests. Design your own critter (e.g. the 8-bit apple, not Pac-Man).

## 7-Check Acceptance Gate

Claude self-gates the `[auto]` checks before presenting. Ben owns the `[eyes]` checks and the commit.
Claude never self-certifies a commit or flips ⟳→✓ — those happen after the TV pass.

| # | Check | Owner |
|---|-------|-------|
| 1 | **Anchor** present and nameable | [eyes] reads-as |
| 2 | **Drifter** has real trackable translate motion | [auto] |
| 3 | **Safe-area** center stays legible | [eyes] |
| 4 | **In-family color** — all hues in accent→highlight (+ sanctioned exceptions) | [auto] |
| 5 | **Motion** matches the world; no pop-in at load; no weak ease-in | [auto] + [eyes] |
| 6 | **GPU + reduced-motion** — transform/opacity only, guard present | [auto] |
| 7 | **Distinct at thumbnail** — IDs as this theme at small 16:9 | [auto] + [eyes] |

## Port pattern (artifact → ParticleBackground.jsx)

Each ambient is a self-contained block: prefixed palette const, prefixed `rgba` helper, prefixed
keyframes injected via `<style>{XX_STYLE}</style>` inside the component, prefixed sub-components,
reduced-motion guard, and **no own vignette** (ParticleBackground adds the theme `Vignette` after).
Keep the exported function name so `AMBIENT_MAP` still resolves. Never touch shared helpers
(`GlowLayer`, `PulseDot`, shared `ambient*` keyframes) — other ambients depend on them.
